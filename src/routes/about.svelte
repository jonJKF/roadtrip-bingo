	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This project is a last-minute submission to Cloudflare's 2021 Summer Developer Challenge!</p>
	<p>
		It is based on a simplified version of an idea my sister and I came up with many years ago for
		entertaining kids in a car or on a train, that had since been forgotten until she reminded me
		while brainstorming ideas for a fun project to enter in the Developer Challenge!
	</p>
	<p>
		It also served as an opportunity to try out <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
			>Svelte &amp; Svelte Kit</a
		>, <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>
		with its new JIT compiler.
	</p>
